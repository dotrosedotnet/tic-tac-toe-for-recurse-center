# Terminal Tic Tac Toe

Having too much fun coding tic-tac-toe for my application for the Recurse Center.

I'm a 39 year old career switcher focusing on transitioning from life as a musician to life as a coder.

I tried to implement this with some OOP but I keep being turned off by the connection between objects and state.

So I'm mostly sticking to functions and seeing how this works out. It's exhilerating!

## Mighta gone overboard with this

My curious tic tac toe implementation (aspirationally) includes:

- [x] square grid of variable size
  - [ ] size stipulated by command argument
- [x] rules which follow the size of the grid
- [ ] more than two players
