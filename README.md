# Terminal Tic Tac Toe

I'm a 39 year old career switcher focusing on transitioning from life as a musician to life as a coder.

I tried to implement this with some OOP but I keep being turned off by the connection between objects and state.

So I'm mostly sticking to functions and seeing how this works out. It's exhilerating!

I might gone overboard with this. Having too much fun coding tic-tac-toe for my application for the Recurse Center.
